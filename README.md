## Hi!!!
Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm a graduate student at Illinois Tech and primarily interested in Systems and Machine Learning.

## About Me
I have always been fascinated with math and logic, so naturally this led me to choose engineering. During my electrical engineering days, I got fascinated with logic gates, which led to me to transistors, which led me to computers. So, I started learning C on my own and loved it. Upskilled myself with other core computer science concepts like Databases, Git, Operating Systems, etc. Worked as a SWE and fell in love with Machine Learning. Now, I am currently working in NLP and Systems.
